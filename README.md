# Cromatic
Online palette generators are extremely hard to use and cluttered with ads and hard to use interfaces.
Let's make them easier!
Cromatic is a template for what a really user focused color generator would look like. 
The goal is not to get you to create an account or purchase a subscription but to help you create color palettes easily.

## Is there an online instance I can access?
yes! https://hecedu.github.io/Cromatic/

## How do I run my own instance?
1. clone the repo.
2. install npm if you dont have it.
3. run the following command in the root directory of the repo: npm start
4. voila!

## Can I suggest any features/feedback?
Of course! Send me a message or post an issue with your requested change. I will be happy to add it!

## Can I collaborate or make changes to this project?
Cromatic is a personal learning project. You are welcome to create your own fork, but I would rather do everything on my own :)
